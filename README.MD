## 🧠 Fraud Detection using XGBoost (Mini Project)

This is a **basic binary classification project** built for a **college mini project**.
The goal is to classify online transactions as either **fraudulent** or **legitimate** using the **XGBoost algorithm**.

### 🔍 What it does

* Reads a CSV dataset of transactions
* Uses the XGBoost model to classify each transaction as:

  * `1` → Fraud
  * `0` → Not Fraud
* Evaluates the model with simple accuracy or confusion matrix

### 🛠 Tech Used

* Python
* XGBoost
* Pandas
* Scikit-learn (for splitting data and metrics)
